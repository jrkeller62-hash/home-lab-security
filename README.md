# Home Lab Security

This repository documents my cybersecurity home lab, focused on
network segmentation, firewall enforcement, and IT/OT isolation.

## Architecture Overview
- pfSense firewall and router
- Separate LAN and OT_LAN networks
- OT_LAN isolated from LAN
- Controlled OT_LAN → WAN access
- Explicit firewall and NAT rules
- Snapshot-based change control

## Key Outcomes
- Implemented IT/OT network segmentation
- Enforced deny-by-default firewall policy
- Validated routing, NAT, and isolation
- Designed lab with enterprise security principles

## In Progress
- OT network expansion (protocols, roles, monitoring)
- Centralized logging and visibility
- Additional security controls and documentation
